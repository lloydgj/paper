# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale. 

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.

# Methodology
We compared our measurements with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

# Results
The simulations suggest that coagulation is the dominant growth mechanism. 

# Figures
Figures go in their own section in a draft paper.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process. Nonetheless questions remain unanswered, so we should definitely get some more funding.
